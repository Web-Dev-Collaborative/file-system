  <p>Welcome to Travis CI! This page provides some contexts and terminologies used throughout the platform and
    documentation, which might be helpful, if you are new here or new to Continuous Integration (CI).</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-continuous-integration-ci">What Is Continuous Integration (CI)? <a
      href="#what-is-continuous-integration-ci">#</a></h2>
  <p>Continuous Integration is the practice of merging in small code changes frequently - rather than merging in a large
    change at the end of a development cycle. The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in
    smaller increments. This is where Travis CI comes in.</p>
  <p>As a continuous integration platform, Travis CI supports your development process by automatically building and
    testing code changes, providing immediate feedback on the success of the change. Travis CI can also automate other
    parts of your development process by managing deployments and notifications.</p>
  <h2 id="ci-builds-and-automation-building-testing-deploying">CI Builds and Automation: Building, Testing, Deploying <a
      href="#ci-builds-and-automation-building-testing-deploying">#</a></h2>
  <p>When you run a build, Travis CI clones your GitHub repository into a brand-new virtual environment, and carries out
    a series of tasks to build and test your code. If one or more of those tasks fail, the build is considered <a
      href="#breaking-the-build"><em>broken</em></a>. If none of the tasks fail, the build is considered <a
      href="#breaking-the-build"><em>passed</em></a> and Travis CI can deploy your code to a web server or application
    host.</p>
  <p>CI builds can also automate other parts of your delivery workflow. This means you can have jobs depend on each
    other with <a href="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/user/build-stages/">Build Stages</a>, set up
    <a href="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/user/notifications/">notifications</a>, prepare <a
      href="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/user/deployment/">deployments</a> after builds and many
    other tasks.

  <h2 id="builds-stages-jobs-and-phases">Builds, Stages, Jobs and Phases <a href="#builds-stages-jobs-and-phases">#</a>
  </h2>
  <p>In the Travis CI documentation, some common words have specific meanings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>build</em> - a group of <em>jobs</em> that run in sequence. For example, a build might have two
      <em>jobs</em>, each of which tests a project with a different version of a programming language. A <em>build</em>
      finishes when all of its jobs are finished.
    </li>
    <li><em>stage</em> - a group of <em>jobs</em> that run in parallel as part of a sequential <em>build</em> process
      composed of multiple <a href="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/user/build-stages/">stages</a>.
    </li>
    <li><em>job</em> - an automated process that clones your repository into a virtual environment and then carries out
      a series of <em>phases</em> such as compiling your code, running tests, etc. A job fails, if the return code of
      the <code>script</code> <em>phase</em> is non-zero.</li>
    <li><em>phase</em> - the <a
        href="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/user/job-lifecycle/">sequential steps</a> of a
      <em>job</em>. For example, the <code>install</code> phase, comes before the <code>script</code> phase, which comes
      before the optional <code>deploy</code> phase.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="breaking-the-build">Breaking the Build <a href="#breaking-the-build">#</a></h2>
  <p>The build is considered <em>broken</em>, when one or more of its jobs complete with a state that is not
    <em>passed</em>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>errored</em> - a command in the <code>before_install</code>, <code>install</code>, or
      <code>before_script</code> phase returned a non-zero exit code. The job stops immediately.
    </li>
    <li><em>failed</em> - a command in the <code>script</code> phase returned a non-zero exit code. The job continues to
      run until it completes.</li>
    <li><em>canceled</em> - a user cancels the job before it completes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our <a href="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/user/common-build-problems/">Common Builds
      Problems</a> page is a good place to start troubleshooting why your build is broken.</p>
  <h2 id="infrastructure-and-environment-notes">Infrastructure and Environment Notes <a
      href="#infrastructure-and-environment-notes">#</a></h2>
  <p>Travis CI offers a few different infrastructure environments, so you can select the setup that suits your project
    best:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Ubuntu Linux</em> - these Linux Ubuntu environments run inside full virtual machines, provide plenty of
      computational resources, and support the use of <code>sudo</code>, <code>setuid</code>, and <code>setgid</code>.
      Check out more information on the <a
        href="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/user/reference/linux/">Ubuntu Linux Build
        Environment</a>.</li>
    <li><em>macOS</em> - uses one of several versions of the macOS operating system. This environment is useful for
      building projects that require the macOS software, such as projects written in Swift. It is not a requirement to
      use the macOS environment, if you develop on a macOS machine. Here you can find more details on the <a
        href="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/user/reference/osx/">macOS Build Environment</a>.</li>
    <li><em>Windows</em> - currently Windows Server version 1803 is supported. If you want to know more about it, see
      the <a href="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/user/reference/windows/">Windows Build
        Environment</a>.</li>
  </ul>
