  <p><strong>ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the
      goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few
      exceptions:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing.</li>
    <li>ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.</li>
    <li>ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What Is Continuous Integration (CI)? # Continuous Integration is the practice of merging in small code changes
    frequently - rather than merging in a large change at the end of a development cycle. The goal is to build healthier
    software by developing and testing in smaller increments. This is where Travis CI comes in.</p>
  <p>As a continuous integration platform, Travis CI supports your development process by automatically building and
    testing code changes, providing immediate feedback on the success of the change. Travis CI can also automate other
    parts of your development process by managing deployments and notifications.</p>
  <p>CI Builds and Automation: Building, Testing, Deploying # When you run a build, Travis CI clones your GitHub
    repository into a brand-new virtual environment, and carries out a series of tasks to build and test your code. If
    one or more of those tasks fail, the build is considered broken. If none of the tasks fail, the build is considered
    passed and Travis CI can deploy your code to a web server or application host.</p>
  <p>CI builds can also automate other parts of your delivery workflow. This means you can have jobs depend on each
    other with Build Stages, set up notifications, prepare deployments after builds and many other tasks.</p>
